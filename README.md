🔭 I’m currently working on LLM observability 🤖💻 — Exploring the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and how we can monitor their performance.

🌱 I’m currently learning about Agents — Actively watching the following courses:
- **AI Agents Course** offered by [![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hugging%20Face-FFD21E?logo=huggingface&logoColor=000)](#) to deepen my understanding of agent-based systems, using open-source tools.
- **LLM evaluation for builders** offered by [![Evidently AI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Evidently%20AI-EF3E36?style=for-the-badge&logo=chart-bar&logoColor=white)](#) to keep updated on that field.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ideas regarding Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) — Let’s work together on this exciting field!

🤔 I’m searching for new article ideas — Would love some input on topics that could benefit from better explanation or a fresh perspective.

💬 Ask me about Weakly-supervised Learning methods and how to use unlabeled data effectively — Let’s chat about how to improve learning with minimal labeled data!

📫 How to reach me: __stkarlos@upatras.gr__ and / or __karlos.stamatis@ac.eap.gr__

😄 Pronouns: Stam

⚡ Fun fact: Still searching for a destination better than Thessaloniki (**SK**G) — The city that stole my heart!
